/* Jonathan So Task 4
Part 2 There are 10 students enrolled in a course. The course covers x number of chapters from a textbook
(x > 1). In each chapter y number of homework(s) are assigned (y â‰¥ 1). The average grade for each
homework in all the chapters need to be found out.To solve this, write a program that has the main process 
as Director process, which reads a file containing grades of all homework of all chapters and creates x 
number of Manager processes. Each Manager process will take care of solving a chapter. Each manager process 
will create y number of Worker processes and pass one homework to each of them and they calculate and print
the max and average. The input file should contain the data according to the value of x and y */
